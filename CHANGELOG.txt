#####
Version 0.8.0 (2007-06-08) - Codename Unicorn

POP3 :
- As HTML rendering can depend on the client emailer, i decided to include
  a full pop3 implementation. Received mails can be retrieved on a per 
  mailbox basis or using the special account mailbox named 
  'pop3.all@Mailster.host.org'. The password used to retrieve any mailbox 
  content is always the same 'pwd'. 
  
  The pop3 engine uses MINA high performance NIO library.
  (see http://mina.apache.org)

  on which mails were read by removing the bold attribute of the font.

  column purpose.

  icon (when supported by OS of course)

  (for example MailsterSWT -lang=PT would load UI using portuguese resource
  bundle).

- Fix to prevent loosing messages while UI is updating received messages queue.
- Added a UI button to expose CTRL+SHIFT+F4 shortcut that enables to close
  all opened mail tabs at one time.

  you had to restart the server to apply the new timeout value.
- CTRL+A now selects all table elements.
- Added POP3 options to configure port and authentication method of the POP3
  service.
- Added a tree filtering view that groups mail by target hosts. Also introduced a
  trash folder where mails are moved when DEL is pressed. If Shift+DEL is pressed,
  then mails are completely removed from UI and from the special account mailbox.
- Added an about dialog box.     

SWT :
- Fixed Display handling. I will now use the current display if available 
  and will revert to default one when not, except when display object 
  is used for example to create objects like colors and fonts or in 
  static initializations where i use direct calls to Display.getDefault().

CORE :
- Fixed SMTP server handling of clients premature disconnections.

DUMBSTER :
- Event system tightly integrated into Dumbster and new emailReceived event added
- Fixed bug [1313597] : Fix for non-ASCII charsets (like for example Japanese chars)

  required for correct handling of non-ASCII charsets) based on Shinya Kasatani patch
  proposal.
