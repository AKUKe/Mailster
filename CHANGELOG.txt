Version 0.8.0 (2007-06-08) - Codename Unicorn

POP3 :
- As HTML rendering can depend on the client emailer, i decided to include
  a full pop3 implementation. Received mails can be retrieved on a per 
  mailbox basis or using the special account mailbox named 
  'pop3.all@Mailster.host.org'. The password used to retrieve any mailbox 
  content is always the same 'pwd'. 
  
  The pop3 engine uses MINA high performance NIO library.
  (see http://mina.apache.org)
  
GUI :
- Added a read attribute to messages in order to provide visual information
  on which mails were read by removing the bold attribute of the font. 
- Fixed the table lines alternate background coloring.
- Fixed table selection drawing.
- Added an icon to the attachment column to provide some info on the 
  column purpose.
- Added an icon to the filter label.  
- Fixed the width of the refresh spinner.
- Information on UI events now appear on balloon tooltips over trayitem
  icon (when supported by OS of course)
- added a new command line argument to select UI language
  (for example MailsterSWT -lang=PT would load UI using portuguese resource
  bundle).
- Internationalized mail header view.
- Fix to prevent loosing messages while UI is updating received messages queue.
- Added a UI button to expose CTRL+SHIFT+F4 shortcut that enables to close
  all opened tabs at one time.
- Refresh queue timeout modifications are now applied live. In previous versions
  you had to restart the server to apply the new timeout value.
- CTRL+A now selects all table elements.
- Added POP3 options to configure port and authentication method of the POP3
  service.
- Added a tree filtering view that groups mail by target hosts. Also introduced a
  trash folder where mails are moved when DEL is pressed. If Shift+DEL is pressed,
  then mails are completely removed from UI and from the special account mailbox.
- Added an about dialog box.     

SWT :
- Fixed Display handling. I will now use the current display if available 
  and will revert to default one when not, except when display object 
  is used for example to create objects like colors and fonts or in 
  static initializations where i use direct calls to Display.getDefault().

CORE :
- Fixed SMTP server handling of clients premature disconnections.

#####

GUI :

- Added an advanced mail header view which exposes cc and bcc recipients
- When clicking on an individual attached file in the list UI now tries
  to start the shell associated program.
- A search toolbar now offer LIVE mail filtering capabilities based on 
  'subject', and 'to' header fields.
- Improved table and log view look and feel.
- Log view can now be scroll locked.
- UI translation effort on the way ;p 

CORE :
- Fixed server socket creation : socket was listening only to localhost 
  connections since dumbster core modifications introduced hostname binding.

#####
Version 0.6.1 (2007-04-03)

GUI :
- log view is now resizeable
- added choice of rendering browser on windows platforms when IE
  and mozilla/Xul are available
- Internationalized log window messages
- added a debug mode start
- Fixed bug [1680783] : UI locks on email with no Message-Id header

CORE :
- Implemented RFE [1354569] : Bcc recipients are now exposed in API
- Implemented RFE [1474894] : Provided a way to output debugging information
  if VM argument "com.dumbster.smtp.debug" is set then debug info is output 
  to System.err when autostart is set at command line
- Code refactoring 

DUMBSTER :
- Event system tightly integrated into Dumbster and new emailReceived event added
- Fixed bug [1313597] : Fix for non-ASCII charsets (like for example Japanese chars)
  (JDK seems to be required as JRE doesn't install the additionals charset codecs
  required for correct handling of non-ASCII charsets) based on Shinya Kasatani patch
  proposal.
- Fixed issue with extended headers, they're not parsed as regular headers do, leaving
  them intact for further treatment.
